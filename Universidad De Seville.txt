The University of Seville, founded in 1551, is one of the leading institutions of Spain’s higher education system. Its Schools of Philology, Geography and History, Philosophy, Biology and Engineering and its many schools and technological institutes serve the educational needs of some 70,000 students.
Located in the downtown area, the University’s main building is bordered by the Maria Luisa Park and the Guadalquivir River. This building, the completely remodeled historic Tobacco Factory, houses the Schools of Geography and History, Philology, Law, and the main administrative offices.  ICS students enrolled at the University of Seville will appreciate attending classes in the imposing 18th Century building immortalized by Bizet’s opera “Carmen” and by 19th Century travellers in search of Romantic Spain.  The building, complete with moat and watchtowers, is evidence of the importance given to protecting the King’s lucrative tobacco monopoly, which at the time manufactured of all of Europe’s cigars.
