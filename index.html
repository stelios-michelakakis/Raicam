          <p> The use of robots for the inspection, maintenance, and repair (IMR) of critical infrastructure assets will
            revolutionise many sectors1 such as energy generation2,3,4, energy transmission5, civil infrastructure6 and
            utilities7. In fact, for some industries, the use of robotics is the only way to realise their full
            potential.
            For example, offshore wind energy generation is only feasible at the scales required if robotic platforms
            are
            used, from a safety, economic and skills shortage perspective.
            <br>
            Significant research has been conducted within the EU8 and the UK9 over the last 5 years in the field of
            inspection robots and there have been numerous world-leading demonstrations of platforms conducting single
            mission activities in representative environments. The vast majority of these activities have been remote
            inspections, where the robot uses non-contact sensing (e.g., optical, thermal, radiological) coupled with
            geometric scanning to build environmental maps and models.
            <br>
            To realise their full potential, however, robots will need to interact with the environment to perform
            maintenance and repair activities. Environmental interaction is a highly complex activity requiring a
            multi-disciplinary approach combining cognition (perception and reasoning), control, planning and, depending
            on the level of autonomy, human interactions.
            <br>
            One of the most common, low-skilled activities undertaken by human technicians across a range of sectors is
            sampling. Sampling is used to provide information that is representative of the environment from which a
            sample is taken. The aim is to determine the properties (e.g., physical, chemical, biological, radiological)
            of an environment with as much accuracy as possible. Sampling is critical to a number of
            application-agnostic
            practices such as contaminant testing, regulatory testing, environmental analysis, decommissioning, quality
            assurance, and health & safety testing.
            <br>
            Whilst human technicians currently conduct sampling regimes, there is often significant uncertainty
            associated
            with repeatability, accuracy, and efficacy of the samples. A recent study has shown that automated systems
            have the potential to outperform humans when collecting samples10. Humans are also limited as to where they
            can take samples from, either due to environmental hazardous (radiation, chemicals, heat) or location
            (confined spaces or heights).
