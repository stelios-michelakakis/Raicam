Ingenuity is our country’s most important raw material. It enables the efficient and sustainable transfer of scientific knowledge into commercial use. This transfer is the backbone of our innovation system. The coronavirus pandemic has changed our world.  But change brings opportunities. We must gain more sovereignty in key technology areas. From AI – to cybersecurity – to medicine – and transform our economy towards sustainable value creation. We are focusing on strategic research fields – in view of their cross-industry impact and the markets of tomorrow. Now we have the opportunity to become even more resilient than before the crisis. And the opportunity to not only maintain, but also deepen our skills and expertise through a targeted push in innovation. Freedom of action and choice are our goals in order to maintain our position as one of the world’s top players in the most important technology fields. Together, we can emerge from the crisis stronger – and better prepared for future challenges. Let us now set the right course – in harmony with economics and ecology. Fraunhofer. WeKnowHow.
