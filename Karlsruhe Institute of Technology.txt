The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) is “The Research University in the Helmholtz Association.” As the only German university of excellence with a national large-scale research sector, we offer our students, researchers, and employees unique learning, teaching, and working conditions. The roots of the academic education institution extend all the way back to 1825. Today’s structure of KIT is the result of the merger of the Technical University of Karlsruhe and Karlsruhe Research Center in 2009.

Presently, more than 9000 people are working at KIT, of which more than half are conducting research in a broad range of disciplines from natural sciences to engineering, to economics, to the humanities and social sciences. This makes KIT one of the largest science institutions in Europe. Apart from excellent academic education and cutting-edge research, innovation is our central task. We do not only create and impart knowledge for the society and the environment, we also use this knowledge to develop applications for industry. It is our goal to help manage global challenges facing humankind by pioneer research contributions in the areas of energy, mobility, and information. Doing this, we attach high importance to permanent contact and exchange with society.
